"Really? Because I’ve been thinking about our lives lately and perfect attendance does not count as exciting."

"Well, we don't just go to school, we also, um, we, ah, well, there's?.?.?.?and then, of course, er?.?.?." Reed looked to Riley for help, but Riley just shrugged.

“Exactly,” Henry said. “Nothing interesting ever happens. Luckily, I have plenty of ideas."

“What kind of ideas?”

“You leave the details to me.” Henry patted his legal pad confidently.

“Does that mean you’re in charge? Like the boss or something?" Reed always cared about who was in charge. He was the only boy in his family--he had three older sisters and three younger sisters--and he never got his way at home. Never. Not ever.

“Of course not. This is a democracy; we vote on everything."

“Then I vote no. I don’t want to complain or worry anyone, but adventures sound dangerous. And I have a curfew. I don’t have time to change history if I have to be in the house by eight o’clock on weekdays. Or whatever the new way of saying eight o’clock is.”

“The voting starts later, when I tell you each plan. The idea to go ahead with Becoming Men of Action and Daring, Masters of Adventure, well, I’ve already made that executive decision for all of us.”

“Like I said, my curfew is eight on school nights and that’s only if I’ve gotten my homework done. And doesn’t daring usually mean painful? I don’t like pain.” “There might be some pain,” Henry allowed, “but not much. Probably. Hardly any. Maybe a little, but no blood. Definitely no blood. Well, okay, maybe a smidge, but not enough to worry about.” To Reed, Henry sounded as if he’d be disappointed if there weren’t pain and blood.
