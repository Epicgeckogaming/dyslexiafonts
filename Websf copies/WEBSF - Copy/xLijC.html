	The mother of our particular hobbit … what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since they have become 
rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the 
bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps 
them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants 
which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be at in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); 
wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); 
have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it). 
Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this hobbit - of Bilbo Baggins, that is - was the fabulous Belladonna Took, 
one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The 
Hill. It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still 
something not entirely hobbit-like about them, - and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly 
disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer. 
Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo's father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her 
(and partly with her money) that was to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to the end of their days. Still it 
is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his
makeup from the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. The chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so,
and living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his father, which I have just described for you, until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably.

	By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo 
Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed) - Gandalf came by. Gandalf! 
If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort I of remarkable tale. 
Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion. He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not 
since his friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like. He had been away over The Hill and across The Water on business of his own 
since they were all small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls.

	"Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened 
themselves and never came undone till ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons
 and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows' sons? Not the man that used to make 
such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve. Splendid! They used 
to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!" You will notice already 
that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. "Dear me!" he went on. "Not
 the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures. Anything from 
climbing trees to visiting Elves - or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter - I mean, 
you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business."

	"Where else should I be?" said the wizard. "All the same I am pleased to find you remember something about me. You seem to remember 
my fireworks kindly, at any rate, land that is not without hope. Indeed for your old grand-father Took's sake, and for the sake
of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for."

	"I beg your pardon, I haven't asked for anything!"

	"Yes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go so far as to send you on this adventure. Very amusing for
 me, very good for you and profitable too, very likely, if you ever get over it."

	"Sorry! I don't want any adventures, thank you. Not today. Good morning! But please come to tea - any time you like! Why not
 tomorrow? Come tomorrow! Good-bye!"

	With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door, and shut it as quickly as he dared, not to seen rude.
 Wizards after all are wizards.

	"What on earth did I ask him to tea for!" he said to him-self, as he went to the pantry. He had only just had break fast, but
 he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do him good after his fright. Gandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the door, and laughing long but quietly. After a while he stepped up, and with the spike of his staff scratched a queer sign on the hobbit's beautiful green front-door. Then he strode away, just about the time when Bilbo was finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he had escape adventures very well.

	The next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf. He did not remember things very well, unless he put them down on his
 Engagement Tablet: like this: Gandalf Tea Wednesday. Yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of the kind. Just
 before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and then he remembered! He rushed and put on the kettle,
 and put out another cup and saucer and an extra cake or two, and ran to the door.

	The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands, and wondered what had happened, and what was going to happen, and whether they would all stay to supper. Then the bell rang again louder than ever, and he had to run to the door. It was not four after all, t was FIVE. Another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, be-x)re they were all inside, bowing and saying "at your service" one after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were their names; and very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to join the others. Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee, and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while.
A big jug of coffee bad just been set in the hearth, the seed-cakes were gone, and the dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones, when there came-a loud knock. Not a ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit's beautiful green door. Somebody was banging with a stick!
Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and altogether bewildered and bewuthered-this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More dwarves, four more! And there was Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before.
"Carefully! Carefully!" he said. "It is not like you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, and then open the door like a pop-gun! Let me introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!"
"At your service!" said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they hung up two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself, who was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted "pray don't mention it," and stopped frowning.
"Now we are all here!" said Gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods-the best detachable party hoods-and his own hat hanging on the pegs. "Quite a merry gathering!
I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What's that? Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think, for me." "And for me," said Thorin. "And raspberry jam and apple-tart," said Bifur. "And mince-pies and cheese," said Bofur. "And pork-pie and salad," said Bombur. "And more cakes-and ale-and coffee, if you don't mind," called the other dwarves through the door.
