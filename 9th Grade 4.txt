with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away,
all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts
into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober
senses, his real condition of life, and his relations with his kind.
The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the
bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle
everywhere, establish connexions everywhere.
The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world-market given a
cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country. To the
great chagrin of Re-actionists, it has drawn from under the feet of industry the
national ground on which it stood. All old-established national industries have been
destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose
introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations, by industries
that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the
remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in
every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of
the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of
distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of
nations. And as in material, so also in intellectual production. The intellectual
creations of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness
and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous
national and local literatures, there arises a world-literature.
